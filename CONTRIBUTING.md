# Contributing
So you want to contribute? We'd be happy to have you on board. We are just a few programmers who spend our free time developing free and paid software, and would like all the help we can get!
# The NETponents ring system
## Outer ring
This is where you are right now. In this ring, you only have permission to open a fork request, open new issues, and submit a Pull Request when you are done. In order to advance, help out with the source code by forking and opening PRs and being an active member on the Issues page of any repository.
## Ring 2
If we see an active code contributor, we will grant them Ring 2 access. This will add the *Contributor* tag to your name inside any NETponents repository. It will grant you Wiki editing access and a limited range of admin commands on the issues page. To make code changes, you still have to fork and open PRs. However, your PRs will be given priority over PRs opened by outer ring members.
## Ring 1
This is the highest ring any community member can achieve. In addition to all the perks of being in ring 2, you can now directly edit code within the NETponents owned repository (however, we recommend making a separate branch and pulling it when you are done).
## Ring 0
This is where NETponents staff are. Ring 0 members have admin access to all repositories. This is a closed ring, meaning that it is not open to community members.
